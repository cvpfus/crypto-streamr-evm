## Project Overview

CryptoStreamr is revolutionizing live streaming by enabling creators to receive cryptocurrency tips in real-time. Our platform allows viewers to support their favorite streamers, displaying messages on screen for all to see. This enhances audience interaction while offering a decentralized, Web3-native solution to content monetization.

## Key Features
1. Cryptocurrency tipping<br>
Viewers can tip live streamers on Manta Pacific. The transaction is confirmed on-chain, and the tip, along with a message, is displayed on the stream, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

2. On-screen messages<br>
Tippers can send custom messages with their tips, which are displayed to the streamer and the audience. This brings a more interactive, celebratory experience to live streams, similar to traditional platforms but powered by crypto.

3. Seamless Integration for Creators<br>
Streamers can easily integrate CryptoStreamr into their existing streaming setup. The platform is designed to be simple to set up, making it accessible for both new and established content creators in the Web3 space.

4. Web3-First<br>
Built with Web3 principles, creators own their payment channels. No middlemen, ensuring full control and transparent revenue generation for streamers.
